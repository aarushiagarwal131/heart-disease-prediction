# Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart disease in patients based on various clinical parameters. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle.

## Project Structure

1. **Problem Definition:**
   - Can we predict whether or not a patient has heart disease based on clinical parameters?

2. **Data:**
   - The dataset is obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data/data).

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Aim to achieve a 95% accuracy in predicting heart disease during the proof of concept.

4. **Features:**
   - A detailed data dictionary is provided, including information on age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiographic results, and more.

5. **Tools Used:**
   - Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
   - Scikit-Learn's machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.

6. **Steps:**
   - Data loading and exploration.
   - Visualization of data patterns and relationships.
   - Preprocessing and cleaning of the dataset.
   - Model selection and evaluation using different classifiers.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
   - Evaluation metrics including confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and cross-validation.
   - Feature importance analysis.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for step-by-step execution.
5. Explore visualizations, model evaluations, and analysis results.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model performed the best among the selected classifiers. The project provides insights into predicting heart disease based on clinical data, with visualizations and detailed analysis of model performance.
