# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict heart disease in patients based on various clinical parameters. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying whether a patient has heart disease or not. The dataset used for this project is sourced from both the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data/data).

## Project Structure

1. **Problem Definition:**
   - Can we predict whether or not a patient has heart disease based on clinical parameters?

2. **Data:**
   - The dataset includes detailed information on various clinical parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and electrocardiographic results.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - The aim is to achieve a 95% accuracy in predicting heart disease during the proof of concept.

4. **Features:**
   - A comprehensive data dictionary is provided, describing each feature in detail.

5. **Tools Used:**
   - Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
   - Scikit-Learn's machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.

6. **Steps:**
   - Data loading and exploration.
   - Visualization of data patterns and relationships.
   - Preprocessing and cleaning of the dataset.
   - Model selection and evaluation using different classifiers.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
   - Evaluation metrics including confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and cross-validation.
   - Feature importance analysis.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aarushiagarwal131/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Ensure Python Installation**:
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`heart-disease-prediction.ipynb`) for step-by-step execution of the project.

5. **Explore Results**:
   - Once the Jupyter Notebook is executed, explore the visualizations, model evaluations, and analysis results provided in the project.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved the best performance among the selected classifiers. The project offers valuable insights into predicting heart disease based on clinical data, accompanied by visualizations and detailed model performance analysis.
